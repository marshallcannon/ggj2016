# Edible Arrangements - ggj2016
Runner-Up Studio's 2016 Global Game Jam submission

Edible Arrangements is our submission for the 2016 Global Game Jam. It was built in 48 hours in JavaScript using Phaser, Node.js, Socket.io, and Express.

In this game, you must help Brandy gather and store animals in pens to appease a very hungry and exacting giant. If Brandy can't get the right animals into the right pens, he might be the giant's next meal! The catch is that the Giant's instructions can't be viewed on your computer, they can only be viewed on a phone. You'll need two people to accomplish this task: one controlling Brandy with their keyboard, and one on their phone giving directions.

If you want to try the game, just run the server.js file using node and connect your web browser to localhost:3000. Since it's co-op, you'll probably want to find your ip address and connect a mobile phone as well.
